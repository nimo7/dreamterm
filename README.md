# DreamTerm

Happened to find some of my old sources for Amiga during holiday and thought in drunken stupor that it would be nice to 'immortalise' them into GitHub. So here is 20+ years old DTerm sources for the latest released version (1.50). I did minimal cleaning to make it compile.

Note that asm files use tab value of 8, C ones 2. Don't ask about coding choices, I had perfectly valid reasons back then I think :D

No intentional licensed, copyrighted, trademarked or patented functionality used in sources.

Look README_2016.txt for compile instructions.
